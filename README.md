# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to predict if charitable organizations will be successful if they receive funding from Alphabet Soup.

## Results

- Data Preprocessing

  - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
 
    The IS_SUCCESSFUL column determines whether the donation was used effectively and is considered the target of this evaluation.
  
  - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
 
    The APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT columns are the features.
    
  - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

    EIN and NAME are considered identification information and should be removed from the input data.
    

- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

  - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?


  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?


  - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
